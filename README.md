PHP class to parse robots.txt rules according to Google, Yandex, W3C and The Web Robots Pages specifications.

Full list of supported specifications (and what's not supported, yet) are available in our [Wiki](https://github.com/t1gor/Robots.txt-Parser-Class/wiki/Specifications).

### Installation
The library is available for install via Composer package. To install via Composer, please add the requirement to your `composer.json` file, like this:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "t1gor/robots-txt-parser": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

and then use composer to load the lib:

```php
<?php
    require 'vendor/autoload.php';
    $parser = new RobotsTxtParser(file_get_contents('http://example.com/robots.txt'));
    ...
```

You can find out more about Composer here: https://getcomposer.org/

````php
<?php
require_once 'source/robotstxtparser.php';

$parser = new RobotsTxtParser(file_get_contents('http://example.com/robots.txt'));
$parser->setUserAgent('MySimpleBot');

if ($parser->isAllowed('/')) {
	// Crawl of the frontpage is Allowed.
}
// or
if ($parser->isDisallowed('/path/to/page.html')) {
	// Crawl of /path/to/page.html is Disallowed
}

// also you can get the sitemap

### Contributing
First of all - thank you for your interest and a desire to help! If you found an issue and know how to fix it, please submit a pull request to the dev branch. Please do not forget the following:
- Your fixed issue should be covered with tests (we are using phpUnit)
- Please mind the [code climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/t1gor/Robots.txt-Parser-Class) recommendations. It some-how helps to keep things simpler, or at least seems to :)
- Following the coding standard would also be much appreciated (4 tabs as an indent, camelCase, etc.)

I would really appreciate if you could share the link to your project that is utilizing the lib.
